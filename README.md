# Chaos

Chaos is a 2D particle simulator. You can define colored particles types with different behavior, laws of attraction and
repulsion.

This application has nothing to do with realistic physics. It's just a playful experiment which can be really relaxing
to watch in fullscreen.

This project was inspired by https://github.com/HackerPoet/Particle-Life. I ported it to Java and added many options to
play with.
